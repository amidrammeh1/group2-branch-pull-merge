Plants are green, and bring life to the world. I love plants. 
Plants give us oxygen that we need to breath. People use it to stay alive, yet people destroy them. I guess living isn't cool or something.
plants have many purposes. They can be used to simply decorate a space like a house or garden. They're also used in many cultures for at home remedies
Whats photosynthesis?  its the process where green plants use organisms use sunlight to synthesie foods from Co2(carbon dioxide) and H2o(water!)
Plants are green mostly but are also have many other colors.
Plants are mainly multicellular organisms,meaning a tree,flower,bushes,seaweed are all plants 
We are all so knowledgeable about plants. We have studied plants for years.
