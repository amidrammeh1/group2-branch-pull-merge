Plants are green, and bring life to the world. I love plants. 
Plants give us oxygen that we need to breath. People use it to stay alive, yet people destroy them. I guess living isn't cool or something.
plants have many purposes. They can be used to simply decorate a space like a house or garden. They're also used in many cultures for at home remedies
